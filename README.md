Data Analysis Project On Zomato Bengaluru Restaurants

In this Zomato Bengaluru Restaurants data analysis project, I have utilized IBM Cloud Db2-Oc database to write queries. Employing various types of clauses and conditions, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and window functions, I thoroughly analyzed the data. Specifically, I explored the top restaurants by dinner ratings using advanced window functions and identified the best restaurants in different areas within the robust environment of IBM Cloud Db2-Oc.
