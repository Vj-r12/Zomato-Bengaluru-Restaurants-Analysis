Data Analysis Project On Zomato Bengaluru Restaurants

In this zomato bengaluru restaurants data analysis project. I have used postgreSQL tool to write query. and i have used various types of clauses and conditions for analyzing the data. I have analysed the top restaurants by dinner ratings with help of window functions and top restaurants in the area wise. These analyses involves using clauses such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and window functions, among others.
